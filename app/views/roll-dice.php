// Add a view named roll-dice.php. Instead of just returning the random number, show the view and have it display the random number.
// Modify the route to take in a parameter named guess. Someone will access the route by visiting http://blog.dev/rolldice/1, where 1 is their guess.
// Modify the route and view so that you can display the guess in addition to the roll and also tell if the guess matches the roll.
