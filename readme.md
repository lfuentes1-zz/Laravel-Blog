Letty's Laravel Blog

This is my blog written in PH, JS, jQuery, and CSS on the Laravel framework using the MVC Architecture.

##Getting Started
- Clone this repository
- Create a database for this application
- Create a '.env.local.php' file inside of 'blog.dev/'
- Add the contents of 'env-template.php' to '.env.local.php'
- Add your database logins credentials to the values
- Run 'composer install'

This project is built using a Model-View-Controller architecture.
